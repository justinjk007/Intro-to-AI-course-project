* SDL2 is the main rendering library used

 *SDL2_image* add-on is also used to load add-ons

** On Windows
*** Setup SDL2
- Download SDL2 libs from [[https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php][here]]
- Specifically you need the Developmental libs.
- I am using Visual Studio right now and I downloaded =SDL2-devel-2.0.8-VC.zip=
- Extract it somewhere, I extracted it to =C:\Dev\SDL2-2.0.8=
- Create a new file named =sdl2-config.cmake= in there with the following content

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake
set(SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/include")
# Support both 32 and 64 bit builds
if (${CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P} MATCHES 8)
  set(SDL2_LIBRARIES "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/lib/x64/SDL2.lib;${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/lib/x64/SDL2main.lib")
else ()
  set(SDL2_LIBRARIES "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/lib/x86/SDL2.lib;${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/lib/x86/SDL2main.lib")
endif ()
string(STRIP "${SDL2_LIBRARIES}" SDL2_LIBRARIES)
#+END_SRC
